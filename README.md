Pray for Rain
===

Haskell is fun, but I haven't actually made it **do** anything.


Attempt to make something non-academic, but nonetheless pointless, using Haskell.


I.e. a program that interacts with the world in some way.


But doesn't ignore the spiritual realm either:

APIs are available for:
* Weather - Weather Underground
* Place names - Zippopotamus
* Texting - Twilio

So: find out the weather in a random town and pray to change it.

Repeatedly.
